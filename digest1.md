# Digest 1 - Examples of AR
## Summary
- ### Industry and Construction
  - AR can be used for discrepancy analysis in industrial facilities. These images show still frames overlaid with CAD information.

  - Drones are increasingly being used for airborne inspection and reconstructions of construction sites. These drones may have some degree of autonomous flight control, but always require a human operator. AR can be extremely useful in locating the drone.
- ### Maintenance and Training
  - AR can present instructions for maintenance engineers to see learn how things work with directly superimposed images. This can provide more effective training and allows personnel with less training to correctly perform the work.
- ### Medical
  - AR integrates the views from X-ray, enabling the physician to see directly inside the patient.
- ### Personal Information Display
  - AR browsers that shows information on the specific objects for users using the location service and compass.

  - Another compelling use case for AR browsing is simultaneous translation of foreign languages. This utility is now widely available in the Google Translate app.
- ### Navigation
  - With improved geo-information, it has become possible to overlay larger structures on in-car navigation system. An example would be  Wikitude Drive, a first-person car navigation system. The driving instructions are overlaid on top of the live video feed rather than being presented in a map-like view.
- ### Television
  - The first and most prominent example AR on television is the virtual 1st & 10 line in American football, indicating the yardage needed for a first down, which is superimposed directly on the TV screencast of a game.
- ### Advertising and Commerce
  - This idea can be realized with AR by superimposing digital movies and animations on top of specific portions of a printed template. When the magazine is viewed on a computer or smartphone, the static pictures are replaced by animated sequences or movies.

  - AR can also be helpful for a sales person who is trying to demonstrate the virtues of a product. Especially for complex devices, it may be difficult to convey the internal operation with words alone.
- ### Games
  - AR can bring digital games together with the real environment. For example, Vuforia SmartTerrain delivers a 3D scan of a real scene and turns it into a playing field for a “tower defense” game.

## Reflection

The examples listed above are only part of what AR does. It is interesting to see so many fields are using the same technology although normal people usually only pay attention to the commercial side of it. This seems to be the pathway for the development of most modern technologies. Born in laboratories, used in industries and military, then commercialized. And it is funny that so many newspaper are posting articles like "Augmented Reality--The Edge-Cutting Technology".
