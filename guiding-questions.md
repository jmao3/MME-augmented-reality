# Guiding Questions
## Introduction
Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are "augmented" by computer-generated perceptual information, ideally across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory. The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment) or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment) and is spatial registered with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment. In this way, Augmented reality alters one’s current perception of a real world environment, whereas virtual reality replaces the real world environment with a simulated one.
## Important Figures
- **Ivan Sutherland**: 1968, he made the first head-mounted display. It is the ancestor for both AR and VR.
- **Myron Krueger**: 1974, he built a room called the Videoplace. It combined projectors with video cameras that surround users in an interactive environment.
- **Tom Caudell**: 1990, he was a Boeing researcher and coined the term "Augmented Reality".
- **Louis Rosenberg**: 1992, he developed Virtual Fixtures, the earliest functioning AR system built for the Air Force.
- **Julie Martin**: 1994, the first augmented reality theater "Dancing in Cyberspace" is produced.
- **Canon Inc. and the Japanese government**: 1997, fund the largest industrial research facility for mixed reality research, called the Mixed Reality Systems Laboratory.    
- **Hirokazu Kato**: 2000, the ARToolKit, the world’s first open-source software library, is created.
- **Wafner and Schmalstieg**: 2003, present the first handheld AR system on a ‘personal digital assistant’. This leads the way for AR on smart devices.
- **Google**: 2012, launches Google Glass.
