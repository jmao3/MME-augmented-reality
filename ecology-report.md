At this point, augmented reality headsets have not reached the general public due to two major reasons. The first is that the technology is not mature enough to be massively reproduced in a low price. Therefore, most companies that produce AR goggles now target toward industries and corporations, who are willing to pay high prices for improving efficiency. Another reason is that the softwares on the platforms are not useful enough. For example, one of the primary reasons for the success of the smartphones is that they offer all kinds of apps that significantly benefit the life of individuals. AR does not have that now, but it might in the foreseeable future. Therefore, I will write about my conjectures on the environment it creates after the technology is popularized.

Just like smartphones, which give people the ability to access information anywhere, AR will further extend that in several different ways.

First, not only does it offer new information, the information is integrated with the environment, thereby blurring the boundaries between virtual and real life. People would get used to having virtual things overlaid on the real world. This can range from a screen (or any other interface) for todayâ€™s news to a giant dinosaur roaming through the city. The ability individuals would gain from the technology can be indulging. Just like people today are constantly on their phones, if AR succeeds to popularize, it will create a more indulging and ubiquitous effect. People might feel uncomfortable without it because the real world is too dull.

Second, AR can rebuild the face to face relationships that the smartphones have damaged. Instead of the single screen everyone focuses on, the environment built by AR can be shared among people face to face. This would bound people together better and change the dynamic of social interactions nowadays.
