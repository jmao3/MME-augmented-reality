## Summary
- ### Mixed Reality
  -  The space between reality and virtual reality, which allows real and virtual elements to be combined to varying degrees, is called mixed reality.
- ### Virtual Reality
  - Virtual reality immerses a user in a completely computer-generated environment.
- ### Ubiquitous Computing
  - His work anticipates the massive introduction of digital technology into everyday life.

  - Ubicomp is primarily intended as “calm computing”; that is, human attention or control is neither required nor intended. However, at some point, control will still be necessary. A human operator away from a desktop computer, for example, may need to steer complex equipment. In such a situation, an AR interface can directly present status updates, telemetry information, and control widgets in a view of the real environment. In this sense, AR and ubicomp fit extremely well: AR is the ideal user interface for ubicomp systems.

  ## Reflection
  This article does not seem to provide much information. However, the concept of Ubiquitous Computing souds very interesting. It presents a sci-fi future that I might be able to see within a decade.
