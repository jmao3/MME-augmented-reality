# Digest 4 - Is AR Contact Lenses Possible?
## Summary
According to the first article, AR contact lenses are still quite far from us. There are so many obstacles in terms of putting AR onto contact lenses. There have been successful researches that had put contact lenses with a display into eyes of rabbits. However, that's about it. And one of the researchers claims that even realizing AR contact lenses in twenty years wouldn't be an ambitious task.

One of the major obstacles is power. Although certain solution like using the kinetic energy of blinking, it is far from supporting enough energy.

However, the second article offers more hope. It claims that there has already been companies, one of which being eMACULA, that managed to make such things into products. The energy that is such a big concern in the former article doesn't seem to be a big problem. The company claims that the product is undergoing FDA inspection because it includes contact lenses, and it will release the product soon after the inspection finished.
## Reflection
It is funny that the two articles are written in the same month have such different opinions. Therefore, I visited the website of the company eMACULA to see what it looks like. Instead of using only contact lenses for display, the company also has glass displays that facilitate the AR experience. Unfortunately, the website looks like a Dribbble project with beautiful visuals but little concern with the usability and limited information. I highly doubt it's authenticity. It claims that the product will come out in early 2018. Hope I will be proved wrong.
