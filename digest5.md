# Digest 4 - Current AR Products
## Summary
At this stage, most AR devices are directed towards industries and businesses. The author concludes that the main reason for that is besides industries, it is hard to find things that would be useful to everyday users (other than gaming). Therefore, many companies, large or small, are only developing things for businesses.

Examples include Epson Moverio BT-300, AtheerAiR Glasses and other products that do not usually come into the public's view. Even Google Glass, which seems to be a failure, is still used in hospitals, warehouses, and remote service industries. Interesting applications for this device include its use with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by the government of Nepal to track rhinos, tigers, and elephants.

Microsoft Hololens, the most promising commercial AR headset now, it's main target users are still enterprises. Early adopters include Case Western Reserve University, NASA, Saab, and Volvo.

## Reflection
It is interesting how widely used the this technology is in industries, yet the general public only sees the products that are commercially adopted.

The author points out that there should be a reason for the public to have demands for such things before it will be a mature technology, and there are limited signs of it. Maybe the AR softwares on smartphones would be the pioneer for what might come after.
