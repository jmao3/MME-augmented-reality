## Summary
Three other elements have enabled the mass adoption of AR apps:
- meaningful content
- convincing and realistic interaction of the virtual with the physical environment
- unique value that goes beyond what other technologies deliver.

Phase 1: Attention-grabbing early efforts

- The first commercial AR application appeared in 2008. It was developed for advertising purposes by German agencies in Munich. They designed a printed magazine ad of a model BMW Mini, which, when held in front of a computer’s camera, also appeared on the screen. Because the virtual model was connected to markers on the physical ad, a user was able to control the car on the screen and move it around to view different angles, simply by manipulating the piece of paper.

- AR technology was used to engage customers at events or in public spaces. These types of displays aren’t always scalable, as they require considerable investment.

Phase 2: Trying on products at home

- Simulating digital products, so that they interact with movements in the real world in real time (usually through paper printouts), was a popular approach to AR in the early 2010s, especially for watches and jewelry. This technology let people virtually “try on” a product.

-  Trying on products virtually, by instant face recognition, has been one of the most successful uses of AR in the commercial context so far, and make-up companies have been leading this use.

Phase 3: A broader range of uses

- Aside from try-ons, a rich body of research also shows that AR can be incredibly valuable for exploring various cultural, historical, and geographic aspects of an environment. This type of app typically operates on the basis of a user pointing his mobile device towards an object or a site, in order to see superimposed content on the screen.

- the Museum of London has an app that shows you how the particular London street you’re standing in used to look in the past—you just have to point your phone camera at it for the augmented version to appear on your screen.


However, our research has also shown that despite the increased use of such technologies, consumers are not yearning for the robotic digitization of their everyday lives. Rather, they want technologies that weave themselves seamlessly into their activities.



## Reflection
This article provides interesting insights into the commercial field of AR. The three elements the author mentions, are crucial for the success of a product in my opinion. She also mentions the three phases AR is going through, and points out the need for more seamless, empathetic technology integrated into users' life. This is important for me, who is interested in interaction design. As the tide of commercial AR coming, how should designers adapt the new technology?s
